# React-nativefirst-app

Hey there, hope you are doing great.

This repo is for the react-native app. It is suitable for begginers who just learned react-native and wants to improve them self and made fluency in it.

# What is react native

It's a framework desined by the developers in facebook so that they can create cross-platform mobile application. Later they made it open-source so that other developers can use it.

# What is cross platform in mobile application development

It means a code which needs to be written only once, but it will work for both Android and iOS becasue previously developers were requied to learn seperate languages so that they can develope mobile application.

Android => Java
iOS => Swift

But with the introduction of react-native, we are required to write the code only once and it will run for both platforms.
